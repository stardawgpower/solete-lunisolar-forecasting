Description:
SOLETE includes 15 months of measurements at different sampling rates (1sec, 1min, 5 min, 60min)
from the 1st June 2018 to 1st September 2019 covering: Timestamp, air temperature, relative humidity,
pressure, wind speed, wind direction, global horizontal irradiance, plane of array irradiance, 
atmospheric pressure, active power recorded from an 11 kW Gaia wind turbine and a 10 kW PV inverter, 
Sun's azimuth and elevation angles.

The origin of the data is SYSLAB, part of the Wind and Energy Systems department at the Technical University
of Denmark (DTU). If you want to learn more about the dataset, you should check out [1].

The SOLETE dataset was originally disclosed in [1] to increase the transparency and replicability
of [2], [3], and [4]. Yet, SOLETE's enormous potential to facilitate derived research motivated
the development of the SOLETE platform (see Related publications above). Said platform started
as a few Python scripts allowing to import and plot pieces of the dataset. But nowadays is a 
comprehensive platform facilitating training of physics-informed machine learning models for time-
series forecasting.
